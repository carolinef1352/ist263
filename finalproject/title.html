        Many skiers and snowboarders always hope to travel out West to get the best powder. However, I am biased in saying that the Northeast has the best skiing for those not lucky enough to be accustomed to the conditions out West. I will rate various mountains in the Northeast by level of difficulty, social scene, conditions, food, and I will provide recommendations for restaurants. Follow this webpage to see ratings and descriptions of my favorite locations!
