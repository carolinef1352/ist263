            My name is Caroline Francoeur and I am a Policy Studies major at Syracuse University. I recently declared a minor in Information Management and Technology and I am interested in a career in consulting and data analytics. I hold many leadership positions such as Director of Philanthropy and Director of Recruitment for Relay for Life. In addition to this, I have gained grant writing and data analyst skills through the internships that I have participated in throughout the years. I enjoy sailing, cooking, and skiing and I am the oldest sibling with two younger sisters. I look forward to learning more about coding and its relationship to technology.

           I hope to pursue grad school after college in a large city such as Boston or New York.
