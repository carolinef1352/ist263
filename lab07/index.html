<p>My name is Caroline Francoeur and I am a Policy Studies major at Syracuse University. I recently declared a minor in Information Management and Technology and I am interested in a career in consulting and data analytics. I hold many leadership positions such as Director of Philanthropy and Director of Recruitment for Relay for Life. In addition to this, I have gained grant writing and data analyst skills through the internships that I have participated in throughout the years.
